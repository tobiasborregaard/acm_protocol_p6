- [v3](v3) contains the simulations for the different MODCODs, split into multiple files for simple parallelization.
- `plotter4.py` Creates BER plots for the MODCODs
- `snr_time.py` Generates MODCOS.json, and quantization plots.
- `THRextract.m` Creates thresholds from simulation csv
- [output](output) contains the generated plots and thresholds.
