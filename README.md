# ACM for the AAUSAT Ground Station
The project is a proposed adaptive controlled modulation (ACM) protocol for the AAU student space ground station. The source code features GNURadio implementation of different modulation and encoding schemes (MODCODs) compatible with the CC1120  transceiver. The aim of the protocol is optimizing goodput in a satellite link by varying the MODCODs, when link conditions change the channel SNR. 

## Usage
The project are subdivided by folders:  
[hardware_implementation](hardware_implementation) contains implementations of data link layer and physical layer.  
[simulation_Ber](simulation_Ber) contains bit error simulations of the different MODCODs. 
  


## Prerequisites 
**Software** \
Simulation: MATLAB (+ Communications Toolbox), Python \
Implementation: GNU Radio companion
